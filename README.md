Nice — love the energy. Below is a **practical, realistic, zero→hero 30-day plan** to become a strong Android developer who can build, test, and ship high-quality apps. I’ll give you the recommended modern stack, day-by-day tasks, small projects to build, a code-quality checklist, and next steps after day 30.

---

# Quick foundation (what to focus on first)

* **Language:** Kotlin (Android’s recommended language — start here). ([Android Developers][1])
* **IDE / Tooling:** Android Studio (download latest stable and set up emulator, SDKs). ([Android Developers][2])
* **UI:** Jetpack Compose — modern declarative UI for Android. ([Android Developers][3])
* **Architecture & libs:** Jetpack components (ViewModel, Room, WorkManager, DataStore), Hilt for DI, Kotlin Coroutines + Flow, Retrofit/OkHttp (networking). (These are the “standard toolbelt” for modern apps.) ([Android Developers][4])
* **Study path:** use Google’s official Compose + Kotlin learning paths / codelabs as you go. ([Android Developers][5])

> Short, honest note: 30 days won’t make you a master of everything, but it *will* make you capable of producing well-structured, production-quality apps and the confidence to keep leveling up.

---

# How to use this plan

* Assume **2–3 hours/day** (if you can do 4+ hrs/day you’ll finish faster).
* Follow the day tasks, *code along*, commit every day to GitHub, and build the mini-project for each week.
* Keep mistakes — treat them as learning points. Read official docs and the sample repo “Now in Android” as reference code. ([GitHub][6])

# 30-Day Plan — daily tasks + deliverables

### Week 1 — Setup + Kotlin fundamentals + Compose hello-world

**Day 1 — Tooling & first project**

# After day 30 — how to become *truly* great

1. Read and contribute to open source Android apps (NowInAndroid, samples). ([GitHub][6])
2. Learn advanced topics: modularization, multi-module builds, native (NDK) basics, Kotlin Multiplatform if you want cross-platform. ([Kotlin][7])
3. Pair-program, do code reviews, read other people’s PRs, and follow Android engineers on Twitter/Dev channels.
4. Build 3 portfolio apps that show different strengths (UI, offline, real-time features, payments/notifications).

If you want, I can **immediately** (right now) do one of the following for you — pick one and I’ll generate it in this chat:

1. A GitHub-ready **README + architecture diagram** for your final Notes app.
2. A ready-to-paste **Android Studio project template** (build.gradle snippets, Hilt + ViewModel + Compose starter files).
3. A **daily calendar** (exportable checklist) for the 30 days with checkboxes.
